## üéØ Project Overview

**SeatKit** is an open-source restaurant reservation management system, designed specifically for high-turnover, small-seat restaurants that need sophisticated table management and real-time collaboration.

### Origin Story

- **Original**: iOS Swift app "KoenjiApp" built for a specific Japanese-Venetian restaurant
- **Production**: 9 months in production, 1 restaurant, proven solution
- **Migration Goal**: Port to modern TypeScript web application for broader adoption
- **Vision**: Open source tool for any restaurant to configure and deploy

### Why This Project Matters

- **Problem**: Small restaurants (14-18 seats) with high turnover need sophisticated reservation management
- **Solution**: Real-time, collaborative, visual reservation system with automated sales tracking
- **Impact**: Transforms manual reservation chaos into streamlined, data-driven operations

---

## üè™ Business Context

### Restaurant Profile: Koenji (Original Customer)

- **Concept**: Japanese-Venetian fusion restaurant
- **Size**: 14 dining seats + 4-6 counter bar seats (18-20 total)
- **Style**: Mid-range, high-turnover, intimate atmosphere
- **Beverages**: Japanese sake + natural wines
- **Challenge**: Maximize reservations in minimal space while maintaining quality service

### Current Usage Statistics (Last 7 Days)

- **Database Operations**: 144,220 reads, 1,436 writes
- **API Requests**: 9,000 accepted requests
- **Real-time Connections**: Peak of 6 concurrent snapshot listeners
- **User Base**: ~15 staff members across multiple devices

### Core Business Requirements

1. **High-Turnover Optimization**: Fit maximum reservations without overcrowding
2. **Visual Layout Management**: Staff need to "see" table arrangements and availability
3. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple staff updating reservations simultaneously
4. **Sales Automation**: End-of-shift data entry with manager-only editing
5. **Flexibility**: Handle walk-ins, changes, and special requests dynamically

## üöÄ Technical Mission

### Current State (Swift iOS App)

- **Platform**: iOS-only Swift application
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture, dual SQLite/Firestore storage
- **Key Strengths**: Type safety, offline-first, real-time sync, complex domain modeling
- **Limitations**: iOS-only, single restaurant, over-complex layout system

### Target State (TypeScript Web App)

- **Platform**: Modern web application (desktop + mobile responsive)
- **Architecture**: Modular TypeScript ecosystem (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md))
- **Key Improvements**: Cross-platform, configurable, simplified complexity, open source
- **Performance Target**: Match or exceed Swift app responsiveness

### Migration Strategy

- **Approach**: Parallel development (Swift app continues in production)
- **Data**: No migration required initially
- **Features**: Core features first, then expand beyond original scope
- **Timeline**: Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Polish

## üõ† Development Context

### Solo Developer Project

- **Primary Developer**: Matteo Nassini
- **Goals**: Skill showcase, open source contribution, potential future business
- **Approach**: High-quality, well-documented, production-ready code
- **Timeline**: No hard deadlines, focus on doing it right

### Technology Decisions Made (Phase 1)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete details:

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode) + Node.js 22 + Pure ESM
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type safety
- **Workflow**: GitHub Flow + Conventional Commits + Changesets
- **Package Structure**: types ‚Üí utils/engine/ui ‚Üí api/web

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: Maximum TypeScript strictness, runtime validation with Zod
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, E2E for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting, complex logic explained
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize real-time operations
- **Security**: Validate all inputs, secure authentication, audit dependencies

### Recent Architectural Decisions (Date Handling)

- **Date Objects**: Use `z.coerce.date()` for unified Date handling across API/DB layers
- **Serialization**: Custom Fastify serializer converts Date objects to ISO strings in JSON responses
- **Validation**: Single Zod schema serves as source of truth for both input validation and type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses (to be centralized in future PR)
