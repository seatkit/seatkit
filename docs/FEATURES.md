## üéØ MVP Definition (Must-Have Features)

### Critical Features for Day-One Restaurant Operations

These features are **non-negotiable** - without them, restaurants cannot operate effectively:

#### 1. Timeline/Gantt Chart View üïí

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Based on**: Most-used feature in Swift app

**Description**: Visual timeline showing all reservations for a selected day with time blocks

**User Stories**:

```
As a host, I want to see all reservations for today in a visual timeline
So I can quickly understand availability and plan seating

As a server, I want to see when my tables will be occupied
So I can prepare for service and coordinate timing

As a manager, I want to spot overbooking or gaps at a glance
So I can make adjustments before service starts
```

**Technical Specifications**:

- Smooth scrolling and zooming
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Print-friendly view for physical backup
